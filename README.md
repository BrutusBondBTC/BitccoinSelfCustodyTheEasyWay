# BitccoinSelfCustodyTheEasyWay
A book that teaches you how to go from zero to multi-sig hero.

There are a lot of tutorials that teach you how t take self-custody of your bitcoin. Most of the ideas in this book are not my own, but rather the product of studying bitcoin every day for about nine years.  When I first started out, there was not much information out there. I heard about bitcoin on the Joe Rogan Experience. I read the bitcoin white paper,used the wallet Andreas recomended at the time, and posted my first bitcoin address on Twitter: "I just heard about this bitcoin thing and created a wallet. Can somebody please send me a small ammount.  I'm not begging, I just want to see how this works.

Someone sent me a dollar fifty worth using ChangeTip and told me to buy myself a cup of coffee. I read the bitcoin white paper, but did not understand mouch more than the Abstract. I read Digital Gold, because it was about the only book available. Jameson Lopp had a pretty good bitcoin-resources page, but most of the information you need to learn is fragmente. So I a THen Andreas wrote **Mastering Bitcoin**. I read that book with the hopes of  which is a great book, but too technical for Joe Sixpack. He also had a less technical The Internet of Money series. 

Then a Cambriage Explosioin of books and Podcasts came out.

Bitcoin has a marketing problem.  It would be nice if everyone would find this book on Github, but that is not realistic. I want to keep this book Open Source, but I plan on selling it on Amazon for the lowest price point Amazon will give me permission to.I believe bitcoin is for everybody and i don't want cost to keep someone from saving bitcoin. The poorest among us need bitcoin the most.

If you notice something I may have said wrong,or think of another idea, please raise an issue or make a pull request.
